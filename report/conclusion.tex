\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we presented novel techniques for generating an aggregate representation
of a set of traces, comparing two traces, and comparing a trace with an aggregate
set of traces. Our techniques are based on the insight that the users find
text to be easier to understand than any other means of delivering complex information.
To this extent, we present a text generation pipeline that generates a text representation
for a given trace. These representations are then used to generate a summary of traces
using state-of-the-art Multi-Document summarization techniques. Comparison
between two traces, and a trace and an aggregate of traces are modeled as text comparison tasks
where their difference is measured as a function of the edit distance between their corresponding
text representations.
