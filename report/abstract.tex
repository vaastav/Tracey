    Distributed systems are widespread in usage. Yet, they continue
    to be marred by bugs. Distributed tracing is a widely adopted approach that gives 
    engineers visibility into cloud systems.
    Existing tracing tools support analysis of a
    \emph{single} request and are most useful for debugging correctness
    issues.

    However, diagnosing an issue in the processing of a request,
    requires comparing the execution of a buggy request to a non-buggy request
    or even an aggregate set of requests. Some issues even require comparing
    the behavior of two different sets of requests to identify a potential issue.
    Existing trace analysis tools either do not support these use cases or produce
    an output that is not understandable.

    To rectify this, in this paper we propose a new approach for performing trace
    comparison and aggregation. The key insight of our approach is to derive a
    text representation for each trace and then perform aggregation and comparison
    on texts. The benefit of this approach is two-fold: we can leverage text summarization
    and comparison algorithms; the output produced is text which is understandable for users.
    We present algorithms for generating a text representation from a trace, summarization
    of these text representations to generate a summary of traces, 
    and comparison of traces.
