\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We perform a quantitative evaluation to evaluate
the scalability of our techniques as well as the quality
of the text, comparisons, and the summaries generated.
For the Text Generation and Trace Comparison evaluation,
all results were collected on
an Intel i7-core 3.1GHz processor machine with 32GB of RAM.
For the Trace Summarization evaluation, all results were
collected on an Intel(R) Xeon (R) CPU E5-2690 v3 @ 2.60GHz
with 56GB RAM and an NVIDIA GK210GL [Tesla K80] GPU.

In addition to the quantitative evaluation, we also
performed a qualitative evaluation by conducting
an informal user study with 1 user who is one of the 
leading experts in distributed tracing. Due to time restrictions,
the user was only able to provide feedback about the text generation
and trace comparison techniques.

\subsection{Text Generation}

    \label{fig:summary_cdf}
\end{figure}

To measure the scalability of our text generation appraoch, we measure the time taken
to generate the text for every trace in the DeathStarBench dataset. \autoref{fig:summary_cdf}
shows the CDF of the breakdown of the total time taken to generate the text. The time taken
to generate the text is dominated by the time taken to load the data from the backend server.
However, once the data is available, the time taken to generate the text is less than 10 milliseconds
for all traces.

To evaluate the quality of the text generated, the user mentioned the following:\textcolor{red}{``The first sentence is the interesting one here; the rest of the sentences are a bit difficult to parse.
The interesting parts of the first sentence are the comparisons to general statistics about the trace dataset.  I like the last sentence, because it's starting to push towards deriving a 
root cause for the latency (ie, contention with other tasks), and I think when it's presented as text that's a very digestable representation (vs. some sort of visual interface)."}
This suggests that the expert user believes that the overview paragraph is very useful for explaining root causes of potential problems and does so better than a potential
visual interface might. Although, we can still improve our overview by performing comparison for more statistics that a user might care about. Additionally,
the expert user also suggested \textcolor{red}{``to prune away any boring information and try to get at any root causes (or simply say that the request was normal)"}. This suggests
that text that the execution information being shown to the user is too verbose and we might need to infer some high-level information about the trace instead.
