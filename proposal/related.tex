Summarizing information is just one way of interacting
and aggregating large amounts of data. Visualization is
another way of analyzing large sets of datasets.
Existing tools
for analyzing distributed tracing data focus on
visualizing single traces without showing any sort of aggregations.

With DNewz, we want to explore a different way of understanding large
volumes of data; namely text. We believe that 
Although, combining natural language techniques with existing visualization
tools appears to be a promising approach for an efficient way of analyzing data.
Due to the time constraints, experimenting with this combination remains
out of the scope of this project.
