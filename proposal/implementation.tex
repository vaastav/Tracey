\section{Implementation Approach}

Our tool for generating summaries will be a simple webapp written in Python that provides
an interface for generating summaries of tracing data. The trace data will be stored in
a mysql database which would interact with the Python tool to run various queries on the data.
We will most likely use the ``nltk'' library for various tasks in developing our summarization tool.
