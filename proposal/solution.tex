\section{Proposed Solution}

To accomplish the task of generating a ``daily report'',
we have broken down the report into 3 parts.

We will first generate template-based summaries for the set of traces.
This would include sentences describing key high-level metrics as well
as breakdown of the types of requests that generated the traces.
The second part will be generating a super-summary for all the traces
from the summary of each individual trace generated using the human-annotated
labels in the event logs of the traces.
The third part will include summarizing any mined motifs across the traces
and IDs of potentially anomalous traces which are detected to be anomalies
based on their latency and other metaproperties.
